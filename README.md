# Filter
A filter that extracts certain features of an image via kernels in a convolutional neural network.   
  
A kernel is a matrix of weights that moves over the input and produces an output with desired features extracted. The matrix performs dot product operations with the regions in the input image, and the output of which is a representation of a number between 0 and 255. In a grayscale image, that number corresponds to the brightness of one pixel in the image.
